# Tip Calculator! 💰

A simple Python program that calculates the tip amount based on bill, tip and splits the bill per person

## 🚀 How it works?
1. Asks the user what was the total bill.
2. Asks the user What percentage tip would they would like to give
3. Asks the user How many people will split the bill?

Example:

What was the total bill?
$120.00
What percentage tip would you like to give? (10, 12, 15)
15
How many people will split the bill?
4
Total bill including tip: $138.0
Each person should pay: $34.5

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- `input()` for user input  
- Data type conversion (`float`, `int`)  
- Basic arithmetic operations  
- String formatting with **f-Strings**  
- Print output formatting
