# 🏝️ Treasure Island Game 🗺️

A simple text-based adventure game built with Python where your mission is to find the hidden treasure. Make the right choices and survive the journey to become victorious!

## 🚀 How it works?
1. The game starts with a welcome message and a short narrative.
2. You’re presented with a series of choices (left/right, swim/wait, door colors).
3. Each choice leads to a different outcome — survive or game over.
4. Reach the final correct door to find the treasure!


Example:
Welcome to Treasure Island.
Your mission is to find the treasure.
You're at a cross road. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"
left
You come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.
wait
