# ✊🖐️✌️ Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 🎮

A simple text-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with Python. Play against the computer, make your choice, and see who wins!

## 🚀 How it works
1. The game prompts you to type `0` for Rock, `1` for Paper, or `2` for Scissors.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three choices.
3. Both choices are displayed with ASCII art.
4. The winner is determined based on standard game rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock



Example:
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors Game!
What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors:
